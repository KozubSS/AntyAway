# AntyAway


The idea of AntyAway is to prevent Teams from getting to 'Away' status and hold on 'Online' for a defined peroid of time.

First I created a sciprt that work and print output only in terminal then I started modified it to be avaiable for every person. I decided to create a GUI which will minimalistic and easy-2-use.

In script window you can set duration time of script working. 'Run' button wil start script with given minutes and button 'Stop' will stop and close tkinter window.

Install `mouse_auto` requirements:
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Format source code according to PEP8 rules:
```
black mouse_auto.py
```

Check compliance with PEP8:
```
flake8 mouse_auto.py
